# CiviCRM UX User Guide

This plugin adds many useful shortcodes, some new Caldera Forms smart tags and provides additional functionality to improve the user experience for integrating CiviCRM with a WordPress site.

## Events Calendar Shortcode

Display a CiviCRM Events Calendar on your website using the [FullCalendar Javascript library](https://fullcalendar.io), see [https://fullcalendar.io](https://fullcalendar.io) for more details and [demonstrations](https://fullcalendar.io/demos) of the calendar options available.

Use WordPress shortcode `[ux_event_fullcalendar]` to display an interactive calendar of all CiviCRM Events which are both public and active.

## CiviCRM APIv4 Shortcode

The CiviCRM APIv4 is directly accessible using the `[ux_cv_api4_get]` WordPress shortcode. You can use the CiviCRM APIv4 Explorer to understand how to query CiviCRM using the APIv4.

Below are some examples of how the `[ux_cv_api4_get]` WordPress shortcode can be used.

### Event Listing Example 1

Example code to list single Event Type in ascending order.

The following example code can be inserted into a WordPress page when using the Code Editor mode. This code demonstrates:
* How to apply styles and layout to the listing.
* How to output an CiviCRM Custom Field for an Event. In this example, the field is Event_Extra.Event_Feature_Image which is used to record and display a featured image for the Event.

```
<!-- wp:shortcode -->
[ux_cv_api4_get entity=Event is_public=1 is_active=1 event_type_id=15 start_date=&gt;=:today sort=start_date:ASC]
<!-- /wp:shortcode -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3,"className":"ui-widget-header event-title"} -->
<h3 class="ui-widget-header event-title"><a href="https://example.org.au/event-registration/?id={{api4:id}}" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">[api4:title]</a></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:group {"className":"event-info-group"} -->
<div class="wp-block-group event-info-group"><!-- wp:columns -->
<div class="wp-block-columns"><!-- wp:column {"width":"33.33%"} -->
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:33.33%"><!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center">[api4:Event_Extra.Event_Feature_Image:img]</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Date:</strong> [api4:start_date:%B %E, %Y]</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></div>
<!-- /wp:column -->

<!-- wp:column {"width":"66.66%"} -->
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%"><!-- wp:shortcode -->
[api4:summary]
<!-- /wp:shortcode --></div>
<!-- /wp:column --></div>
<!-- /wp:columns -->

<!-- wp:buttons {"contentJustification":"left"} -->
<div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-left"><!-- wp:button {"className":"is-style-outline","fontSize":"normal"} -->
<div class="wp-block-button has-custom-font-size is-style-outline has-normal-font-size"><a class="wp-block-button__link" href="https://example.org.au/event-registration/?id={{api4:id}}" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Register</a></div>
<!-- /wp:button --></div>
<!-- /wp:buttons --></div>
<!-- /wp:group -->

<!-- wp:shortcode -->
[/ux_cv_api4_get]
<!-- /wp:shortcode -->
```

### Event Listing Example 2

Example code to list multiple Event Types. Same as above, except changes the event_type_id parameter: `event_type_id=IN:18,19`

The following example code can be inserted into a WordPress page when using the Code Editor mode. This code demonstrates how to apply styles and layout to the listing.

```
<!-- wp:shortcode -->
[ux_cv_api4_get entity=Event is_public=1 is_active=1 event_type_id=IN:18,19 start_date=&gt;=:today sort=start_date:ASC]
<!-- /wp:shortcode -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3,"className":"ui-widget-header event-title"} -->
<h3 class="ui-widget-header event-title"><a href="https://example.org.au/event-registration/?id={{api4:id}}" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">[api4:title]</a></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:group {"className":"event-info-group"} -->
<div class="wp-block-group event-info-group"><!-- wp:columns -->
<div class="wp-block-columns"><!-- wp:column {"width":"33.33%"} -->
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:33.33%"><!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center">[api4:Event_Extra.Event_Feature_Image:img]</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Date:</strong> [api4:start_date:%B %E, %Y]</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></div>
<!-- /wp:column -->

<!-- wp:column {"width":"66.66%"} -->
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:66.66%"><!-- wp:shortcode -->
[api4:summary]
<!-- /wp:shortcode --></div>
<!-- /wp:column --></div>
<!-- /wp:columns -->

<!-- wp:buttons {"contentJustification":"left"} -->
<div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-left"><!-- wp:button {"className":"is-style-outline","fontSize":"normal"} -->
<div class="wp-block-button has-custom-font-size is-style-outline has-normal-font-size"><a class="wp-block-button__link" href="https://example.org.au/event-registration/?id={{api4:id}}" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Register</a></div>
<!-- /wp:button --></div>
<!-- /wp:buttons --></div>
<!-- /wp:group -->

<!-- wp:shortcode -->
[/ux_cv_api4_get]
<!-- /wp:shortcode -->
```

### Event Information / Event Registration Page Example

Example code to display Event Information and the Event Registration form. This page will use the Event ID as passed in via the URL to load the related Event Information.

The Event in this example has CiviCRM Custom Fields as follows:
1. Event Feature Image
2. Presenter Heading
3. Presenter Information
4. Presenter Image

The standard CiviCRM Event Registration form is shown at the bottom of the page.

The following example code can be inserted into a WordPress page when using the Code Editor mode. This code demonstrates how to apply styles and layout to the listing.

```
<!-- wp:group {"className":"clearfix"} -->
<div class="wp-block-group clearfix"><!-- wp:shortcode -->
[ux_cv_api4_get entity=Event id=id]
<!-- /wp:shortcode -->

<!-- wp:shortcode -->
[api4:Event_Extra.Event_Feature_Image:img]
<!-- /wp:shortcode -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>[api4:summary]</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:shortcode -->
[api4:description]
<!-- /wp:shortcode -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>[api4:Presenter.Presenter_Heading]</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:group {"className":"alignright"} -->
<div class="wp-block-group alignright"><!-- wp:shortcode -->
[api4:Presenter.Presenter_Image:img]
<!-- /wp:shortcode --></div>
<!-- /wp:group -->

<!-- wp:shortcode -->
[api4:Presenter.Presenter_Information]
<!-- /wp:shortcode -->

<!-- wp:list {"className":"clear-float"} -->
<ul class="clear-float"><li><strong>Starts:</strong> [api4:start_date]</li><li><strong>Finishes:</strong> [api4:end_date]</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:shortcode -->
[/ux_cv_api4_get]
<!-- /wp:shortcode --></div>
<!-- /wp:group -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Registration Details</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:group {"className":"crm-hide-title"} -->
<div class="wp-block-group crm-hide-title"><!-- wp:shortcode -->
[civicrm component="event" action=register set_title=1]
<!-- /wp:shortcode --></div>
<!-- /wp:group -->
```

### Additional usage information

Specifying a non-numeric `id` attribute to the `[ux_cv_api4_get]` shortcode instructs it to use that value parameter in the GET request as the ID, e.g. `[ux_cv_api4_get entity=Event is_public=1 is_active=1 id=event_id]` with the url `http://example.org/event/?event_id=20` will result in the event with id 20 being fetched for the shortcode.

Implicit joins using Api4 are supported, e.g. `[api4:loc_block_id.address_id.street_address]`

Multi-value fields are output as a comma separated list where possible.

Limited format support is available:

* Date fields can have their format specified with the same format as [CiviCRM's date display](https://docs.civicrm.org/user/en/latest/initial-set-up/dates/), e.g. `[api4:start_date:%B %E, %Y]`
* File upload fields can be output as images with width, height, and alt text specified, e.g. `[api4:My_Custom_Field_Group.Image_Upload:img:800x300:alt=A picture]`
* A line break tag can be output with fields only when they contain data with `:br`, e.g. `[api4:My_Custom_Field_Group.Optional_Field:br]`

### CiviCRM API trouble-shooting

If the CiviCRM API shortcode is not evaluating and returning a **blank** result, check the CiviCRM log file for errors. An error message along with a CiviCRM backtrace will be shown.

As the CiviCRM API requests are performed by the logged in user, verify that this user has the requisite permissions for the API request. This can be performed by executing the same command using the WP or CV CLI.

Using the **wp** CLI:
```wp --user=<WP User Name> cv api4 Contact.get +w id=<Contact ID>```

Using the **cv** CLI:
```cv --user=<WP User Name> api4 Contact.get +w id=<Contact ID>```

For Access Control, grant all users the CiviCRM permission: ```CiviCRM: access all custom data``` as this is required to view Custom Fields for Contacts. 

### CiviCRM API caching

CiviCRM API responses are cached as a WordPress transient with a minimum lifetime of 4 hours.

If the API request is returning the incorrect results or if you have changed the parameters and are not seeing the correct results, then try flushing the WordPress transient cache.

```wp transient delete --all```

## Campaign Shortcode

The Campaign shortcodes accept a CiviCRM Campaign ID as a parameter and display the fundraising goals by querying the CiviCRM Campaign and associated Contributions.
